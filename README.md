## About the project

- This blog was a project developed during a Rocketseat Ignite challenge! The idea was to develop an application from scratch, from the front-end to the connection with Prismic CMS for the publication of posts.

&nbsp;

## üíª What's in the project?

- Very clean front-end, developed following the proposal in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0Y26j0tf1K2WB5c1ja5hov/Desafios-M%C3%B3dulo-3-ReactJS?node-id=0%3A1) .
- Integration with Prismic CMS, to work with every part of the blog system.
- Integration with Prismic's Preview system, where it is possible to see an unpublished post within the blog, even before it goes live.
- Use of Next.js static system, where posts are kept in cache for better loading.
- Commenting system using Utteranc.
